        <p>
            My name is Gayuh Tri Rahutami but my friends usually call me Tami. I was born in Jakarta in 2001 
            and have lived there until I left for college. I'm now a Computer Science student in Institut 
            Teknologi Bandung.
        </p>

        <p>
            I first got into programming when I was in my first year of high school 
            after learning a little bit about competitive programming. 
            Honestly though, I didn't do a lot of practice back then and only started 
            to pick up programming again once I'm in college, so my skill is still a 
            little bit rusty. (I'm trying!)
        </p>

        <h3 class="paragraph-heading">Things that I can do (though I'm not particularly good in it):</h3>

        <div class="things">
            <h4>Playing Games</h4>
            <p class="desc">
                I usually play casual games instead of competitive ones. 
                Some games that I like to play: 112 Operator, Overcooked 2, Cities: Skyline, other simulation games.
            </p>
            <h4>Watching Netflix</h4>
            <p class="desc">
                Unique thing about me is that I get bored easily when watching 
                movies or series. I don't usually finish a movie in one sitting and 
                there are only a handful number of series I've finished watching. 
                <br><br>
                But here's a list of my favorite movies: The Rise of the Guardians, 
                The Chronicles of Narnia series, Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse. (yes, I love animation and fantasy.)
            </p>
            <h4>Reading Books</h4>
            <p>I read both fiction and non-fiction books. Two of my favorites are Wonder and Nevermoor series.</p>
